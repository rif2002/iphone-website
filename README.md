# About this Project
This is a React-based responsive web project showcasing the iPhone 15 Pro with rich multimedia features including videos, images, and a 3D model (GLB format). It uses modern web technologies like React, GSAP for animations, and Three.js for 3D rendering. The project is built and deployed using Vite and hosted on GitHub Pages. It demonstrates smooth scroll-triggered animations, video playback control, and interactive 3D model integration, aiming to provide an engaging and visually appealing user experience.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
